# CNC Milling Workflows

A guide for CNC milling, covering machinist jargon, material standards, feeds and speeds, CAM workflows with Autodesk Fusion 360 & Vetric Aspire, and milling workflows for Shopbot & Bantam Tools machines - all through a collection of milling micro-projects ranging from a 1 to 1.9 Million scale mill of Mars's Gale Crater to brass wax seals.
